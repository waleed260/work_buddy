## 2026-05-13 - Visual Hierarchy in Text-based Interfaces
**Learning:** In a CLI or chat-based interface, users can easily lose track of importance when tasks are presented in a simple list. Using consistent color-coded emojis (🔴, 🟡, 🔵) combined with priority sorting creates an immediate visual hierarchy that helps users focus on what matters most first.
**Action:** Always implement sorting by priority for task/event lists and use consistent visual markers for severity or priority levels across all status-related outputs.

## 2026-05-17 - Scanning Efficiency and Encouraging Empty States
**Learning:** Placing priority markers immediately after status indicators (e.g., `🔄 🔴 Title`) creates a tighter anchor for the eye, allowing users to scan both completion status and urgency in a single vertical pass. Additionally, using "delightful" empty states (emojis like 🥳, 🚀) transforms a "no results" dead-end into a moment of positive reinforcement, which is critical for a productivity-focused agent.
**Action:** When displaying lists, group meta-information (status, priority) before the content. Always enhance empty states with encouraging language and positive emojis.

## 2026-06-06 - Scannability of Multi-line List Items in CLI
**Learning:** When presenting list items with multiple properties (like Email or Slack drafts) in a CLI, using bold labels (e.g., **To:**) provides clear visual anchors. Furthermore, indenting subsequent lines of an item to align with the first line's text (ignoring the bullet) prevents the text from "leaking" back to the left margin, which maintains the vertical rhythm and makes it much easier to distinguish between different list items.
**Action:** Use bold Markdown for property labels and ensure multi-line content is indented by exactly two spaces to match the primary bullet's text alignment.

## 2026-07-11 - Metadata Consistency and Informational Parity
**Learning:** When users see a task in a "Completed" section of a summary (like a Daily Standup), they often lose the context of how important or urgent that task was. Maintaining "Informational Parity" by showing priority emojis and due dates even in completed states provides a stronger sense of accomplishment and closure, while keeping the visual language consistent with "In Progress" lists.
**Action:** Centralize entity formatting (e.g., tasks) into single helper functions that preserve all relevant metadata (priority, due dates) regardless of the entity's state (completed vs. pending) or the specific view (list vs. summary).
